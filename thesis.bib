This paper argues it is dangerous to think of these quick wins as coming for free. Using the software engineering framework of technical debt, we find it is common to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs in real-world ML systems. We explore several ML-specific risk factors to account for in system design. These include boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, configuration issues, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns.},

    abstract = {This chapter summarizes the properties of the singular value decomposition, which are relevant for data analysis. The chapter describes the way in which the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a noise-free data set for which the spectra, f, and concentration, c, vectors are known can be calculated from consideration of the integrated overlaps of these components. Because data analysis necessarily begins with matrices, which are “noisy” at some level of precision, the chapter describes some of the properties of the SVD of matrices, which contain noise. It describes the SVD of random matrices (that is, matrices containing only noise). The chapter explores the way the random amplitudes are distributed in the SVD output when noise is added to a data matrix by using perturbation theory. The chapter discusses the significant advantages that result from the application of SVD and complementary processing techniques for the analysis of large sets of experimental data.}

However, the lack of knowledge about the global status of web archiving initiatives hamper their improvement and collaboration. To overcome this problem, we conducted two surveys, in 2010 and 2014, which provide a comprehensive characterization on web archiving initiatives and their evolution. We identified several patterns and trends that highlight challenges and opportunities. We discuss these patterns and trends that enable to define strategies, estimate resources and provide guidelines for research and development of better technology. Our results show that during the last years there was a significant growth in initiatives and countries hosting these initiatives, volume of data and number of contents preserved. While this indicates that the web archiving community is dedicating a growing effort on preserving digital information, other results presented throughout the paper raise concerns such as the small amount of archived data in comparison with the amount of data that is being published online.},

   abstract = {Web crawlers have been misused for several malicious purposes such as downloading server data without permission from the website administrator. Moreover, armoured crawlers are evolving against new anti-crawler mechanisms in the arm races between crawler developers and crawler defenders. In this paper, based on one observation that normal users and malicious crawlers have different short-term and long-term download behaviours, we develop a new anti-crawler mechanism called PathMarker to detect and constrain persistent distributed crawlers. By adding a marker to each Uniform Resource Locator (URL), we can trace the page that leads to the access of this URL and the user identity who accesses this URL. With this supporting information, we can not only perform more accurate heuristic detection using the path related features, but also develop a Support Vector Machine based machine learning detection model to distinguish malicious crawlers from normal users via inspecting their different patterns of URL visiting paths and URL visiting timings. In addition to effectively detecting crawlers at the earliest stage, PathMarker can dramatically suppress the scraping efficiency of crawlers before they are detected. We deploy our approach on an online forum website, and the evaluation results show that PathMarker can quickly capture all 6 open-source and in-house crawlers, plus two external crawlers (i.e., Googlebots and Yahoo Slurp).},

But trees derived with traditional methods often cannot be grown to arbitrary complexity for possible loss of generalization accuracy on unseen data. The limitation on complexity usually means suboptimal accuracy on training data. Following the principles of stochastic modeling, we propose a method to construct tree-based classifiers whose capacity can be arbitrarily expanded for increases in accuracy for both training and unseen data. The essence of the method is to build multiple trees in randomly selected subspaces of the feature space. Trees in, different subspaces generalize their classification in complementary ways, and their combined classification can be monotonically improved. The validity of the method is demonstrated through experiments on the recognition of handwritten digits.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a multi-class AdaBoost based on incorporating an ensemble of binary AdaBoosts which is organized as Binary Decision Tree (BDT). It is proved that binary AdaBoost is extremely successful in producing accurate classification but it does not perform very well for multi-class problems. To avoid this performance degradation, the multi-class problem is divided into a number of binary problems and binary AdaBoost classifiers are invoked to solve these classification problems. This approach is tested with a dataset consisting of 6500 binary images of traffic signs. Haar-like features of these images are computed and the multi-class AdaBoost classifier is invoked to classify them. A classification rate of 96.7\% and 95.7\% is achieved for the traffic sign boarders and pictograms, respectively. The proposed approach is also evaluated using a number of standard datasets such as Iris, Wine, Yeast, etc. The performance of the proposed BDT classifier is quite high as compared with the state of the art and it converges very fast to a solution which indicates it as a reliable classifier. },

abstract = {Abstract Classification and regression trees are machine-learning methods for constructing prediction models from data. The models are obtained by recursively partitioning the data space and fitting a simple prediction model within each partition. As a result, the partitioning can be represented graphically as a decision tree. Classification trees are designed for dependent variables that take a finite number of unordered values, with prediction error measured in terms of misclassification cost. Regression trees are for dependent variables that take continuous or ordered discrete values, with prediction error typically measured by the squared difference between the observed and predicted values. This article gives an introduction to the subject by reviewing some widely available algorithms and comparing their capabilities, strengths, and weakness in two examples. © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.
